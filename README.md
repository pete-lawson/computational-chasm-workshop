## Workshop Learning Objectives

1. Understand what `Jupyter Notebooks` are, how they are used, and when it is appropriate to use a `Jupyter Notebook` for data visualization and analysis.
2. Understand how `Jupyter Notebooks` can be decoupled into a `server` and `web-client` and how this can be useful for scaling data analysis.
3. Understand how to deploy a `Jupyter Notebook` using the service Binder to enable reproducible research.
