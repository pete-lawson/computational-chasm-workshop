## Workshop Learning Objectives
This workshop 

1. Understand what `Jupyter Notebooks` are, how they are used, and when it is appropriate to use a `Jupyter Notebook` for data visualization and analysis.
2. Understand how `Jupyter Notebooks` can be decoupled into a `server` and `web-client` and how this can be useful for scaling data analysis.
3. Understand how to deploy a `Jupyter Notebook` using the service Binder to enable reproducible research.

## Additional Resources 

The [Jupter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) is a an open-source, web-based application that can be run locally, or shared online, and allows you to create and share documents (notebooks) that contain live code, visualizations, narrative text, and mathematical equations. They provide a wonderful way of documenting and sharing your research with the world. 

### Sharing your Jupter Notebook. 
These notebooks are rendered natively in Github so you can share them with others. They can be managed under versioning control using Git, and shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to manage and share your Git repositories. For more information on versioning control and how to create a Git project and share it with the world follow the [Software Carpentries tutorial on Version Control with Git and Github](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

### Jupyter Notebook Shortcuts
To see a list of keyboard shortcuts, in a running Jupyter notebook first enter command mode by hitting `esc`. Then press the `h` key to display the help menu, which will display common operations and their corresponding shortcuts. These shortcuts are operating system dependent, so if you call the `h` prompt from Windows your shortcuts will look different than if you call `h` from a Mac.

### Presentations with Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter is extensible, that is you can add extensions to it in order to enhance its functionality. One such extension is the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/maint-5.6/) extension. __RISE__ stands for __Reveal.js -- Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension__. This extension allows you to toggle between a normal notebook instance and an interactive presentation mode. The introduction to Data Visualization presentation at the beginning of the workshop was simply a Jupyter Notebook in RISE mode.
